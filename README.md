# JAVA_OOP_SYBTECH
<h2>Some conventions which we follow to write programs:</h2>
<h5>-Every program of the practice sheet is to be solved in java programming language only</h5>
<h5>-Every program should be saved with the question number(i.e,class having the main function should be of problem number)</br> f.e., if you are solving problem number 11 of 3rd practical then the program should be saved as "Program3_11.java" for ease to find the solution of each question</h5>
<h5>- Make sure that the program is representable (meaningful output lines, indentation and other better coding practices)</h5>


                                                         ...and we are good to go
